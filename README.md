# Sentiment Classifier
 A logistic regression sentiment classifier by extracting unigrams, bigrams and further processed features and training classifier on text data.
 The framework code is largely adapted from NLP courses by Dr. Greg Durrett at UT Austin (https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~gdurrett/courses/fa2019/cs388.shtml) and Prof. Huan Sun at OSU (http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~sun.397/courses/au2020/cse5525.html).
